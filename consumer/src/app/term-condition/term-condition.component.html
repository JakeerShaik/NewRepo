     <label> 2. How SAMA will serve you.</label>  
      </p>
      <p>
       <label> 2.1. The "SAMA Loans" Service.</label> 
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>2.1.1.</b> Description: "SAMA Loans" is a closed-end installment loan product
        with standard terms of 3, 6, or 12 months (other terms may be available at
        select promotion times) offered by <u>Al Hail Orix Finance PSC </u>through
        SAMA's technology platform. Loan term options may vary based on you credit
        scoring and banking history. "SAMA Loans" allows you to benefit from short
        term loans when in need of cash fast for personal or business use. If you
        agree to use "SAMA Loans" services you promise to repay the same amount
        plus a finance charge as determined by your creditworthiness.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b> 2.1.2.</b> Your Promise to Pay: Before completing any loan disbursa for any
        SAMA Services, SAMA will secure your promise to pay by disclosing the terms
        and conditions applicable to that transaction and securing your SAMA active
        consent to those terms for that transaction, including your promise to pay
        the Total Payments amount to Al Hail Orix Finance PSC or its assigns, by
        asking you to click the button to confirm your loan.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>2.1.3.</b> Interest Rates: "SAMA Loans" rates range from 5% to 25% fixed Annual
        Percentage Rate ("APR"), depending on your creditworthiness (0% APR is
        offered at select loan products). "SAMA Loans" are simple interest loans,
        which means that interest accrues daily on the unpaid principal balance, up
        to the amount of the finance charge, until you pay the loan in full. If,
        however, you pay your loan off early, the Prepayment Refund terms below may
        apply.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>2.1.4.</b> Finance Charge: The “SAMA Loans” service is subject to a finance
        charge based on the applicable interest rate determined by your
        creditworthiness. SAMA will always disclose the specific finance charge
        before you agree to any loan.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>2.1.5.</b> First Payment: Your first payment will be due no sooner than 15 days
        after the loan amount disbursal.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b> 2.1.6.</b> Late Payment Fee: You will be charged a fee of 1% of your EMI.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b> 2.1.7.</b> Payment Allocation: Payments that you make will be applied first to
        accrued unpaid interest then to the unpaid principal balance. For loans
        that are delinquent, your payment will be applied first to past due
        amounts, then to your current monthly payment. For loans that are charged
        off, your payment will be applied first to the unpaid principal balance,
        then to accrued unpaid interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b> 2.1.8.</b> Partial Prepayments: Payments in excess of your currently scheduled
        payment will be applied to your unpaid principal balance and will not be
        used toward your next scheduled payment. Thus, your monthly scheduled
        payment amounts will remain the same except for your final payment.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b> 2.1.9.</b> Prepayment Penalty: You may prepay your loan in full at any time but
        you will be charged 1% of the total loan outstanding amount as penalty fee.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b> 2.1.10.</b> Prepayment Refund: You are entitled to a refund of any amounts you
        pay in excess of the remaining principal balance and accrued interest as of
        the date of prepayment. We, however, may set off any amounts you are
        entitled to against any amounts you owe on any other “SAMA Loans” loan or
        owe us otherwise. In lieu of a prepayment refund, you may satisfy your
        repayment obligation under the “SAMA Loans” service on any date prior to
        the date of the final payment by paying SAMA an amount equal to the unpaid
        balance, less the required rebate as of the date of such a payment.

        account. There may be times when a tool we offer is unavailable or not
        properly functioning, and you agree that we have no liability to you if
        this occurs or in connection with the tools generally. You may need certain
        hardware or software to utilize the tools, and you understand that your
        failure to have such hardware or software will result in your not being
        able to use the tools or some tool functionality. You understand that some
        tools or some tool functionality may only be available to consumers who
        have relationships with certain lenders, service providers or financial
        institutions or who have certain financial products. If you do not have
        such relationships or products, you understand that you may not be eligible
        to use a tool or all of its functionality. You agree that we may use
        information we gather through the tools to market other products and/or
        services to you, including those of third parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>2.2.3.</b> Third Party Providers: We may rely on third party providers to
        assist us in making a tool or other SAMA Service available to you. By
        linking your SAMA account to a tool or Service, you authorize us and our
        third party providers to access your financial accounts on your behalf, and
        to gather information about you. You give us and our third party providers
        a limited power of attorney, and appoint us and our third party providers
        as your true and lawful attorney-in-fact and agent to act on your behalf
        and access, transmit, and use your information as necessary to provide the
        tools and other Services. You agree to the transfer, storage, and
        processing of your information by these third party providers in accordance
        with their respective privacy policies, including SAMA Privacy Policy. We
        have no liability to you for any damages you may suffer as a result of any
        such third party's actions or inactions or from inaccurate account
        information.

       <label> 5.2. Mandatory Arbitration.</label>
      </p>
      <p>
        THIS SECTION AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS, PLEASE READ CAREFULLY BEFORE AGREEING TO
        THESE TERMS OF SERVICE BY USING THE SAMA SERVICE OR THE WEBSITE. Except as
        explicitly provided in this Agreement, any dispute or claim relating in any
        way to your visit to the Website, your use of the SAMA Services, a product
        offered or provided by or through the Website or Service, or otherwise
        arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Services that cannot be
        resolved directly between you and SAMA shall be resolved by non-appearance
        based binding arbitration, rather than in court. Except as otherwise
        provided in this Agreement, this includes any claims based in contract,
        statute, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory. UAE law
        apply to this Agreement. There is no judge or jury in arbitration and court
        review of an arbitration award is limited, but an arbitrator can award an
        individual the same damages and relief as a court and must apply and follow
        the terms of this Agreement as a court would. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT
        THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY
        TRIAL.
      </p>
      <p>
        The arbitration shall be conducted by telephone or electronic means and/or
        shall be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner of which
        shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration
        shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses
        unless the arbitrator determines that an in-person hearing is necessary
        based on the request of one of the parties and any judgment on the award
        rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and may be entered in any court
        of competent jurisdiction. You and SAMA each agree that any dispute
        resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and
        not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a
        claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right
        to a jury trial and agree to proceed only on an individual basis and not in
        a class, consolidated, or representative action. The parties hereby appoint
        the arbitrator the exclusive power to rule on any challenges to the
        requirement for the use of alternative dispute resolution process in these
        terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to obtain interim
        or preliminary injunctive relief necessary to protect the rights or
        property of you or SAMA and all of its partners, affiliates, shareholders,
        employees, and agents of any kind (together, our "Affiliates").
      </p>
      <p>
        Except as explicitly provided elsewhere in this Agreement, all claims you
        bring against SAMA must be resolved in accordance with this Section. Any
        claim filed or brought contrary to this Section shall be considered
        improperly filed. Should you file a claim contrary to this Section, SAMA
        may recover from you attorneys' fees and costs, provided that SAMA first
        has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim and you have
        failed to promptly withdraw the claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       <label> 5.3. Restrictions.</label>
      </p>
      <p>
        You and SAMA agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the dispute
        between SAMA and you individually. To the fullest extent permitted by law,
        (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no right or
        authority for any dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to
        utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right or authority for
        any dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf
        of the general public or any other persons.
      </p>
      <p>
        <label> Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration.</label>
      </p>
      <p>
        You and SAMA agree that the following disputes are not subject to the above
        provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (1)
        any disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of,
        any of your or SAMA's intellectual property rights; and (2) any claim for
        injunctive relief.

      </p>
      <p>
        SAMA operates and controls the Services from its offices in the United Arab
        Emirates. SAMA makes no representation that the Services are appropriate or
        available in other locations. The information provided on the Services is
        not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any
        jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to
        law or regulation or which would subject SAMA to any registration
        requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons
        who choose to access the Services from other locations do so on their own
        initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if
        and to the extent local laws are applicable. Software from the Services may
        be subject to United Arab Emirates export controls. By downloading any
        software, you represent and warrant that you are not located in, under the
        control of, or a national or resident of, any other country. The parties
        specifically disclaim application of the Convention on Contracts for the
        International Sale of Goods. These Terms of Service are effective until
        terminated by either party. You may terminate these Terms by destroying all
        Service-related materials obtained from the Service, SAMA or any other
        website or source and paying all amounts you owe (including any fees or
        expenses incurred or imposed by SAMA) in full. The privileges granted to
        you under these Terms of Service will terminate immediately and
        automatically without notice from SAMA if, in our sole discretion, you fail
        to comply with any term or provision of these Terms of Service. Neither the
        course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act to modify
        these Terms of Service. You may not assign these Terms of Service without
        SAMA's prior written consent, but SAMA may assign these Terms of Service
        and its rights and obligations hereunder to any party at any time without
        any notice to you. No waiver by either party of any breach or default
        hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent
        breach or default. The section headings used herein are for convenience
        only and shall not be given any legal import. Upon SAMA's request, you will
        furnish SAMA any documentation, substantiation or releases necessary to
        verify your compliance with these Terms of Service. You agree that these
        Terms of Service will not be construed against SAMA by virtue of having
        drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may have based on
        the electronic form of these Terms of Service and the lack of signing by
        the parties hereto to execute these Terms of Service.

       <label> 6.2. Enforceability and Governing Law.</label>
      </p>
      <p>

        Terms of Service does not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

        with regard to your use of the SAMA Services and any previous Terms of
        Service that may exist between you and SAMA is hereby superseded. These
        Terms of Service cannot be changed or modified by you except as posted on
        the Services by SAMA. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
        unenforceable, the unenforceable term or provision shall be replaced by an
        enforceable term or provision that comes closest to the intention
        underlying the unenforceable term or provision and the remaining provisions
        shall be enforced. To the extent that anything in or associated with the
        Services is in conflict or inconsistent with this Agreement, this Agreement
        shall take precedence.
